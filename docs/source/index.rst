Indigo :sup:`®` is a real-time issues tracking and management system for operation centres. It is designed
for easy to use, open and transparent communication between people, departments and
organisations during operations. It can be operated from anywhere on a network including remote
locations via VPN and 4G.
When information is recorded in Indigo® it instantly becomes available to all other users who can
read and contribute information. Whilst designed to be transparent, sensitive information can be
restricted if required. Indigo® can also be used as a tasking tool, setting tasks to be actioned by
yourself or others.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
